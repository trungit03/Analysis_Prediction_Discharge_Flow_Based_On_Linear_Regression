# **Discharge Flow Prediction**
## Overview
* This project focuses on building a model to predict discharge flow for hydropower reservoirs.
* Data used: Using selenium to scrape data on the website of Vietnam Electricity Company [EVN](https://www.evn.com.vn/c3/thong-tin-ho-thuy-dien/Muc-nuoc-cac-ho-thuy-dien-117-123.aspx). Data is taken from 2021 to July 16, 2024. The data has more than 39,000 records.
* Additionally using Streamlit to create a basic website and then embed the model in it.
